    "\n",
    "        *   **disease_all:** This table contains information about various diseases, including their names and potentially related Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) concepts. Key columns might include disease names in English and Chinese, and possibly links to other relevant data.<br>**Use For**: Disease identification, medical classifications, symptom mapping, disease relationships.\n",

Key columns might include gene identifiers and names.<br>**Use For**: Disease identification, medical classifications, symptom mapping, disease relationships.\n",

It includes details such as TCM names, English names, Latin names, properties, meridians, functions, and indications.<br>**Use For**: Traditional TCM knowledge, herb properties, meridian theory, classical indications\n",

    "\n",
    "        ## Key Relationships & Data Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "        **Primary Research Chain**: Herbs → Ingredients → Genes → Diseases\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Critical Connections:\n",
    "        1. **TCMBank_ID**: Links herbs to their constituent ingredients\n",
    "        2. **Source_ID**: Cross-references across external databases\n",
    "        3. **Traditional-Modern Bridge**: Herb indications ↔ Disease classifications\n",

    "\n",
    "        ## Retrieval Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Query Processing Strategy:\n",
    "        1. **Identify Query Type**:\n",
    "          - Traditional TCM (herb names, properties, meridians)\n",
    "          - Chemical/Molecular (compound names, structures, targets)\n",
    "          - Medical (diseases, symptoms, conditions)\n",
    "          - Mechanistic (how/why questions about TCM effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. **Multi-File Search Approach**:\n",
    "          - **Single Entity Queries**: Start with the most relevant file, then expand\n",
    "          - **Relationship Queries**: Search across multiple files simultaneously\n",
    "          - **Mechanism Queries**: Follow the Herb→Ingredient→Gene→Disease pathway\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. **Search Field Prioritization**:\n",
    "          - **Primary**: Exact name matches, IDs\n",
    "          - **Secondary**: Aliases, synonyms, alternative names\n",
    "          - **Tertiary**: Descriptions, functions, classifications\n",
    "          - **Contextual**: Related terms, broader categories\n",
    "\n",
    "        ### Specific Retrieval Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "        **For Traditional TCM Queries**:\n",
    "        - Search herb_all for: TCM_name, Properties, Meridians, Function, Indication\n",
    "        - Cross-reference with ingredient_all using TCMBank_ID\n",
    "        - Link to disease_all through indication matching\n",
    "\n",
    "        **For Chemical/Pharmacological Queries**:\n",
    "        - Search ingredient_all for: compound names, molecular properties, ADMET data\n",
    "        - Connect to gene_all for target information\n",
    "        - Trace back to herb_all for source herbs\n",
    "\n",
    "        **For Disease/Medical Queries**:\n",
    "        - Search disease_all using multiple classification systems\n",
    "        - Find related genes in gene_all\n",
    "        - Identify targeting ingredients in ingredient_all\n",
    "        - Trace to source herbs in herb_all\n",
    "\n",
    "        **For Mechanism/Integration Queries**:\n",
    "        - Follow complete pathway: specific herb → active ingredients → molecular targets → disease effects\n",
    "        - Use cross-references and IDs to maintain data integrity\n",
    "        - Combine traditional knowledge with molecular evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
